Description

This project implements a document search system using vector embeddings and FAISS for efficient retrieval. It leverages PyMuPDF for PDF text extraction, Langchain for text splitting, Sentence Transformers for text encoding, and FAISS for indexing and search.

Features

Processes PDF documents.
Splits documents into manageable chunks with optional overlap.
Creates sentence embeddings using a pre-trained Sentence Transformer model.
Builds a FAISS index for efficient vector search.
Performs vector search to retrieve relevant passages based on a query.
